ITS 362 Distributed Application Development
Lab 03 jQuery


Objectives:
1. To understand how jQuery works
2. To learn to use jQuery in client-side scripting
3. To learn to develop a client-side application using jQuery

Tasks:
This lab is based upon one of the previous labs. You are going to revise it so that jQuery will be used. 
You should use as much of jQuery as much as possible even though many tasks can be done using JavaScript alone.

Here are a few requirements:
1) Each assignment (lab, quiz, etc.) should be added to the HTML page as needed. When your HTML page is loaded, 
there should be no assignment textbox(es). You will need to provide a mechanism (such as buttons) to add assignments 
with scores as needed (up to a limit of 5). Please make sure that each type of assignment does not exceed its limit. 

2) The grade calculation may be done by pressing a calculate or submit button or upon hitting the enter 
key when entering a score for any graded item. 

3) You should test your code in at least two (2) different browsers.

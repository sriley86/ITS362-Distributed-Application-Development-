Intro to PHP

1. Create an HTML file with embedded PHP that calculates a discount for a product.  You can hardcode the product price and discount percent and use the function to calculate the discount.

2. Use a $GLOBALS[] array to reference and update the variables.

3. Display the product name, price, discount and discounted price.

4. Create a class called ÔEmployeeÕ (in another file, if youÕd like), this class should have at least three variables (up to your discretion). A constructor should be created that will set the three variables that were declared in the class.

5. You should have at least two different functions in your class. One will display a message whenever it is called, and the other will perform some calculation using at least one of your variables.

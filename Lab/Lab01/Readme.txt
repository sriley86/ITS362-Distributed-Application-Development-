Lab 01 JavaScript Programming



Objectives:
1.	To create a client-side application using JavaScript
2.	To get familiar with the JavaScript development process
3.	To learn how to program and debug in JavaScript
4.	To learn to use JavaScript code and events to interact with HTML elements

Tasks:
Based upon what we learned, add JavaScript code and events to a grading HTML page so that all the 
calculations are done properly and correctly. You should be able to enter student scores for each 
category and then calculate a grade based on the percentage split.  The grading criteria for the course 
are as follows.

Please pay attention to your coding style. At this point, you should have developed a good habit of 
writing professional type of programming code.

Please do not use any JavaScript frameworks/libraries which have not been covered in the course.

You should have at least 2 separate code files: html, and js. A .css file is not required but is still highly 
encouraged.

Deliverables:
An electronic copy of all your code files and screen shots must be submitted to Brightspace. Please zip 
everything.

ITS 362  Distributed Application Development
Lab 04 jQuery UI


Objectives:
1. To understand how jQuery UI works
2. To learn to use jQuery UI in client-side scripting
3. To learn to develop an appealing client-side application using jQuery UI

Tasks:
This lab is built upon the previous labs. You are going to revise them so that jQuery UI 
will be used where applicable. You should use as much jQuery UI as much as possible even 
though many tasks can be done using JavaScript alone.

Here are a few requirements:
1) Use the tabs widget to group assessments. That is, all labs should be included in a single tab, 
and all quizzes should be in another tab, etc. There should be a place to display the total % points 
and grade. I leave this to your imagination and creativity.

2) For each textbox, please provide a custom tooltip to inform the user what is expected to enter. 
This tooltip should track and follow the userï¿½s cursor when hovering over it.

3) The calculation of the total % points and grade should be done on the fly without using any button. 

4) Provide a way to remove the last assessment (a textbox) from each list.

You should have a separate .css file for any styles you need for this app, and a separate .js file for JavaScript.

Please follow the good coding styles, use modules, and adopt meaningful names and good naming convention.

Tasks:For this lab, you are to create a database in phpMyAdmin of a list of students. The table of students should include at least 5 columns (age, first name, last name, etc.)You should then create a webpage that will populate a PHP file with an HTML table with all of the data from your database table. Create something (buttons/links/forms/etc.) underneath the HTML table that will show a selection of the data in the HTML table depending on which buttons or links are clicked (ages over 25, names not containing an integer). You should also have a database error page that will display should the database not connect properly. Main page Ð index.php Ð Used safari browser as Chrome would not display all css file infoStudent Name query Ð name_form.phpStudent Hometown query Ð hometown_form.phpStudent Age query Ð age_form.phpStudent Major query Ð major_form.phpStudent Gender query Ð gender_form.phpStudent GPA query Ð GPA_form.php

Tasks:
For this lab, you are to create a database in phpMyAdmin of a list of students. 
The table of students should include at least 5 columns (age, first name, last name, etc.)

You should then create a webpage that will populate a PHP file with an HTML table 
with all of the data from your database table. Create something (buttons/links/forms/etc.) 
underneath the HTML table that will show a selection of the data in the HTML table 
depending on which buttons or links are clicked (ages over 25, names not containing an integer). 
You should also have a database error page that will display should the database not connect properly.
